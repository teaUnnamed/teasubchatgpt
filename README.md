# Tea Subscription MVP

This repository contains two HTML files for a simple tea subscription MVP:

- `index.html` – a more detailed landing page
- `mvp_mockup.html` – a minimal page to collect leads

You can host the site for free using **GitHub Pages**.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) and push the contents of this folder to it.
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-user>/<your-repo>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. On GitHub, open your repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Branch**, select `main` (or your default branch) and save.
4. GitHub will provide a link such as `https://<your-user>.github.io/<your-repo>/` where the site will be available in a minute or two.

If you place your landing page in `index.html`, it will load automatically. Other pages like `mvp_mockup.html` will be accessible by their filenames (`/mvp_mockup.html`).
